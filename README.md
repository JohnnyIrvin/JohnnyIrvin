## I'm Currently Learning

I'm currently expanding my skillset by diving into Android Development. My primary goal is to gain the ability to write Android applications, as it will lay the foundation for my next objective: learning how to reverse engineer these applications to identify vulnerabilities. I'm fortunate to be learning from my friend [Chase Montgomery](https://github.com/Blufenix), whose expertise in Android development is invaluable.

Through this learning journey, I aim to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to analyze and discover vulnerabilities within Android applications. This will serve as a stepping stone towards my ultimate aspiration of delving into the realm of Android itself, with the aim of uncovering vulnerabilities in the operating system.

Stay tuned for exciting projects and collaborations as I progress in Android development, reverse engineering, and the pursuit of securing the Android ecosystem.
